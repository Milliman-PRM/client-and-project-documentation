# Client and Project Documentation

This repository is where client and project level documentation is captured and stored. Client level documentation will be added to a client specific folder through a pull request. Documentation for each project will be stored in a separate issue.

The "code" section of this repository contains the various documentation templates and checklists.

## Usage

#### Client Setup
Users should open a pull request creating a folder for the client and adding the appropriate documentation using the `client_setup` checklist. Only a Principal should review/merge the client setup pull requests.

#### Project Setup
Users should create an issue for each new project using the `project_setup` template. After completing the checklist this should be reviewed/merged by a Principal with the attestation from the `project_risk_level` template.

## Changes to templates/checklists

Anyone is welcome to suggest changes to the templates/checklists via pull requests. However, only a Principal should review/merge the pull requests.
